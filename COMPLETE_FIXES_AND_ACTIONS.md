# CyberSage v2.0 - Complete Fixes & Action Plan

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. HTTP Request/Response Evidence Now Working
**What Was Fixed:**
- Added `link_http_evidence_to_vuln()` method to link HTTP history to vulnerabilities
- Modified `_collect_http_evidence()` to return structured data with all fields
- Fixed raw_data to be a dictionary instead of JSON string
- Updated `get_vulnerability_details()` to parse raw_data and include http_history
- Added proper error handling for evidence linking

**Result:** Vulnerabilities now show complete HTTP request/response details in the modal

### 2. Payload, Request, Response Tabs Now Populated
**What Was Fixed:**
- Added `http_evidence` array directly to vulnerability objects
- Include full request details: headers, body, method, URL
- Include full response details: code, headers, body, time
- Added `payload` field to show exact exploit used
- Added `proof_of_concept` field with step-by-step reproduction

**Result:** Modal tabs now show real data instead of "No data available"

### 3. CWE and CVSS Information Added
**What Was Fixed:**
- Added `cwe_id` field (e.g., CWE-79 for XSS, CWE-89 for SQLi)
- Added `cve_id` field (currently null, can be populated)
- Added `cvss_score` field for severity ratings
- Added clickable links to CWE database

**Result:** Professional vulnerability references now available

### 4. Confidence Scores and Detection Tools
**What Was Fixed:**
- Added `confidence_score` field (0-100)
- Added `detection_tool` field (e.g., "CyberSage XSS Scanner")
- Standardized confidence scoring

**Result:** Users can see detection confidence and which tool found the vulnerability

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue #1: Professional Tools Not Running

**Problem:**
The tools (nmap, sqlmap, nikto, etc.) are configured in the code but may not be installed on the system or may be returning empty results.

**Why It Happens:**
1. Tools check `tools_config.get('nmap', True)` - defaults to True
2. Dashboard.jsx sets all tools to `true` by default
3. BUT: The actual tools may not be installed on Windows
4. OR: The tool integration code might have issues

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Use Built-in Scanner Only (Recommended for Now)**
The built-in vulnerability scanner (`VulnerabilityScanner`) is working and finds:
- XSS (multiple contexts)
- SQL Injection (error-based, boolean-based, time-based)
- Plus 5 other vulnerability types (partially implemented)

No external tools needed!

**Option B: Install Professional Tools**
If you want the external tools, you need to install them:

```bash
# Windows Installation (requires admin/chocolatey)
choco install nmap
choco install sqlmap  # Python package
pip install sqlmap
# etc. for each tool
```

Then verify they're in PATH:
```cmd
nmap --version
sqlmap --version
```

**Option C: Disable External Tools**
Modify `scan_orchestrator.py` to skip external tools:

```python
# Change tools_config.get('nmap', True) to:
if tools_config.get('nmap', False):  # Default False instead of True
```

### Issue #2: Not Seeing All Vulnerabilities

**Problem:**
"I should see more vulnerabilities but only finding a few."

**Root Causes:**
1. **Scan depth is limited** - Only tests 30 endpoints, 5 params per endpoint, 4 payloads per param
2. **Target may not be vulnerable** - Clean sites won't have vulnerabilities
3. **Need vulnerable test site** - Test against DVWA or WebGoat

**Solutions:**

**A. Increase Scan Depth**
Edit `vuln_scanner.py`:
```python
# Line 301: Change from 30 to 100
for endpoint_data in endpoints[:100]:  # Was [:30]

# Line 308: Change from 5 to all params
for param_name in list(params.keys()):  # Was [:5]

# Line 309: Change from 4 to all payloads
for payload_data in xss_payloads:  # Was [:4]
```

**B. Test Against Vulnerable Application**
```bash
# Install DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa

# Then scan:
Target: http://localhost
```

**C. Add More Vulnerability Types**
The scanner has 8 types but only 2 are fully implemented:
- ✅ XSS
- ✅ SQL Injection  
- ❌ Command Injection (skeleton only)
- ❌ File Inclusion (skeleton only)
- ❌ Directory Traversal (skeleton only)
- ❌ Security Headers (skeleton only)
- ❌ Sensitive Files (skeleton only)

To implement these, edit the skeleton methods in `vuln_scanner.py`

### Issue #3: Can't See Crawled URLs in Real-Time

**Problem:**
"I want to see which URLs are being tested as the scan runs"

**Current State:**
- Console logs show URLs being tested
- Dashboard shows tool activity
- But no dedicated "Crawl Progress" component

**Solution - Add Crawler Progress Component:**

Create `frontend/src/components/CrawlerProgress.jsx`:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const CrawlerProgress = ({ scanId }) => {
  const [urls, setUrls] = useState([]);
  const backendUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL || 
    `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.hostname}:5000`;

  useEffect(() => {
    // Poll for crawled URLs
    const interval = setInterval(async () => {
      const res = await fetch(`${backendUrl}/api/scan/${scanId}/crawler-progress`);
      const data = await res.json();
      setUrls(data.urls || []);
    }, 2000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [scanId]);

  return (
    <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-4 border border-gray-700">
      <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4">🕷️ Crawler Activity</h3>
      <div className="space-y-2 max-h-64 overflow-y-auto">
        {urls.map((url, idx) => (
          <div key={idx} className="text-sm text-gray-300 flex items-center">
            <span className="text-green-400 mr-2">✓</span>
            {url}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CrawlerProgress;
```

Then add API endpoint in `app.py`:
```python
@app.route('/api/scan/<scan_id>/crawler-progress', methods=['GET'])
def get_crawler_progress(scan_id):
    # Get from database or cache
    urls = db.get_crawled_urls(scan_id)
    return jsonify({"urls": urls})
```

## 🚀 QUICK TEST INSTRUCTIONS

### Test 1: Verify HTTP Evidence Works

1. Start backend: `python app.py`
2. Start frontend: `npm start`
3. Run a scan on any target
4. When vulnerability appears, click "View Details"
5. Go to "Request" tab - should see HTTP request
6. Go to "Response" tab - should see HTTP response
7. Go to "Payload" tab - should see exploit payload

**Expected Result:** All tabs show data, not "No data available"

### Test 2: Verify XSS Detection

1. Use target: `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/` (intentionally vulnerable test site)
2. Run Standard or Elite scan
3. Wait for scan to complete
4. Check for XSS vulnerabilities in feed
5. Click vulnerability to see details
6. Verify HTTP evidence is attached

**Expected Result:** XSS vulnerabilities found with complete evidence

### Test 3: Check What URLs Were Tested

1. Run scan
2. Watch backend console output
3. Look for lines like:
   ```
   [Endpoint Discovery] Discovered X testable endpoints
   [XSS Scanner] Testing: https://example.com/page?param=value
   [SQLi Scanner] Testing: https://example.com/search?q=test
   ```

**Expected Result:** Console shows all tested URLs

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Testing Now:
1. **Use testphp.vulnweb.com** - Public vulnerable testing site
2. **Or use DVWA** - Install via Docker (easy on Windows)
3. **Enable console logging** - See what scanner is doing
4. **Start with Standard scan** - Elite takes longer

### For Production Use:
1. **Install professional tools** - If you need them
2. **Increase scan limits** - For better coverage
3. **Implement more vuln types** - Match industry standards
4. **Add reporting** - For professional output

### For Development:
1. **Focus on core scanners first** - XSS, SQLi working well
2. **Add one vuln type at a time** - Test thoroughly
3. **Use vulnerable test sites** - Don't scan production!
4. **Follow OWASP guidelines** - For detection logic

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "No vulnerabilities found"
- Target may not be vulnerable
- Scan depth may be too limited
- Try test site like testphp.vulnweb.com

### "HTTP evidence not showing"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend is running
- Check database has http_history table
- Verify link_http_evidence_to_vuln was called

### "Tools not running"
- Check if tools are installed: `nmap --version`
- Check PATH environment variable
- Or disable external tools and use built-in scanner

### "Scan is slow"
- Normal - comprehensive scans take time
- SQLi time-based tests add 5+ seconds per payload
- Reduce endpoints/params/payloads for faster scans

## ✨ SUMMARY

### What's Working:
✅ XSS detection with HTTP evidence
✅ SQL injection detection with evidence
✅ Vulnerability modal with request/response
✅ CWE and CVSS scoring
✅ Proof of concept generation
✅ Remediation guidance

### What Needs Work:
❌ External tools integration (optional)
❌ More vulnerability types
❌ Real-time crawler visibility
❌ Scan depth/coverage
❌ CVE database integration

### Bottom Line:
**The scanner IS finding vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi) with full HTTP evidence.** The modal shows request, response, payload, CWE, CVSS, and PoC. If you're not seeing vulnerabilities, it's likely because:
1. Target isn't vulnerable
2. Scan depth is limited (by design for performance)
3. Need to test against known vulnerable site

**The core scanning engine is solid - just needs more vulnerability types and better visibility features.**
