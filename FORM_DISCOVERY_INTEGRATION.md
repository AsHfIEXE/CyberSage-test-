# Form Discovery Integration - Implementation Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Backend - Scan Orchestrator (`backend/core/scan_orchestrator.py`)

**Added Imports:**
- `import os` - For environment variable access
- `from tools.form_discovery import EnhancedFormDiscovery, AIFormAnalyzer`

**Updated `__init__` method:**
- Added `self.form_discovery = EnhancedFormDiscovery(database, broadcaster)`
- Added `self.ai_form_analyzer = AIFormAnalyzer(os.environ.get('OPENROUTER_API_KEY'))`

**Added Form Discovery Phase:**
- New Phase 2: Form Discovery (20-40% progress)
- Runs after reconnaissance, before vulnerability scanning
- Discovers forms using `self.form_discovery.discover_forms()`
- AI analysis for top 5 forms in elite mode
- Updated all subsequent phase numbers and progress percentages

**Progress Flow:**
- Phase 1: Reconnaissance (0-20%)
- Phase 2: Form Discovery (20-40%) ‚Üê NEW
- Phase 3: Vulnerability Scanning (40-60%)
- Phase 4: Advanced Detection (60-75%)
- Phase 5: Chain Detection (75-85%)
- Phase 6: AI Analysis (85-95%)
- Phase 7: Finalization (95-100%)

### 2. Backend - Database (`backend/core/database.py`)

**Added `discovered_forms` Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS discovered_forms (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    scan_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    page_url TEXT,
    form_index INTEGER,
    action TEXT,
    method TEXT,
    form_purpose TEXT,
    fields_json TEXT,
    security_analysis_json TEXT,
    ai_analysis_json TEXT,
    discovered_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (scan_id) REFERENCES scans(scan_id)
)
```

**Added Methods:**
- `add_form(scan_id, form_data)` - Store discovered form
- `get_forms_by_scan(scan_id)` - Retrieve all forms for a scan

### 3. Backend - API Endpoints (`backend/app.py`)

**Added Two New Endpoints:**

1. **GET `/api/scan/<scan_id>/forms`**
   - Retrieves all discovered forms for a specific scan
   - Returns JSON with forms array

2. **POST `/api/forms/analyze`**
   - Accepts `form_data` in request body
   - Uses OpenRouter AI to analyze form security
   - Returns AI analysis results
   - Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable

### 4. Frontend - Dashboard Integration (`frontend/src/components/Dashboard.jsx`)

**Added Import:**
- `import ProfessionalFormAnalysisViewer from './ProfessionalFormAnalysisViewer';`

**Added Component:**
- Rendered in main content area (left column)
- Conditional rendering based on `currentScanId`
- Placed after ScanCharts, before ScanHistory

```jsx
{currentScanId && (
  <ProfessionalFormAnalysisViewer scanId={currentScanId} />
)}
```

## Features Enabled

### Form Discovery Features:
- ‚úÖ Automatic form detection during scans
- ‚úÖ Field-level analysis (type, sensitivity, validation)
- ‚úÖ Security risk scoring
- ‚úÖ Common vulnerabilities detection (CSRF, injection points, etc.)
- ‚úÖ AI-powered deep analysis (elite mode only)
- ‚úÖ Remediation recommendations

### UI Features:
- ‚úÖ Professional form analysis viewer
- ‚úÖ Tabbed interface (Overview, Fields, Security, AI Analysis, Remediation)
- ‚úÖ Form list with risk indicators
- ‚úÖ Interactive field details
- ‚úÖ On-demand AI analysis
- ‚úÖ Modern dark theme UI

## Environment Requirements

**Required Environment Variable:**
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - For AI form analysis (optional but recommended for elite scans)

## Usage

1. **Run a Scan:**
   - Start a standard or elite scan from the dashboard
   - Form discovery runs automatically after reconnaissance

2. **View Forms:**
   - Form Analysis Viewer appears in dashboard when forms are found
   - Shows count of discovered forms
   - Click any form to view details

3. **Request AI Analysis:**
   - Navigate to "AI Analysis" tab
   - Click "Start AI Analysis" button
   - AI provides professional security assessment

## Database Migration

The `discovered_forms` table is created automatically when the backend starts. If you have an existing database, the new table will be added without affecting existing data.

## Testing

To test the integration:
1. Ensure backend is running with form_discovery.py available
2. Start a scan on a target with HTML forms
3. Check progress at 35% for "üîç Discovering Forms"
4. View results in the Form Analysis Viewer

## Notes

- Form discovery only runs in 'standard' and 'elite' scan modes
- AI analysis limited to top 5 forms to manage API costs
- Forms are stored per scan in the database
- AI analysis requires OpenRouter API key configuration
