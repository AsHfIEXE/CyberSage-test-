## üîß Configuration

### API Key for AI Analysis
For AI-powered insights, an OpenRouter API key is required.

1.  Create a file named `.env` inside the `backend/` directory.
2.  Add your API key to it:
    ```env
    # backend/.env
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
> Get a free key at **[openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)**. The application will function without it, but AI features will be disabled.

## üöÄ Advanced Features Explained

### Attack Chain Detection
CyberSage intelligently connects individual vulnerabilities to reveal how they can be combined into a high-impact attack.
-   **Example Chain**: `Sensitive File Exposure` -> `Credential Extraction` -> `Internal Access`.
-   **Why it Matters**: It elevates the risk of seemingly low-severity findings and helps prioritize remediation by focusing on the most critical paths.

### Business Logic Scanner
This module tests for flaws unique to the application's logic that generic scanners miss.
-   **Race Conditions**: Sends rapid, parallel requests to endpoints like `/redeem-voucher` to check for double-spend flaws.
-   **Price Manipulation**: Attempts to submit negative or zero values in cart/payment forms to bypass server-side validation.

### Professional Tool Integration
The `ScanOrchestrator` acts as a master controller, deploying a suite of best-in-class open-source tools based on the scan configuration. It automates execution, parses the output, and integrates the findings directly into the real-time feed, correlating them with its own discoveries.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

-   **WebSocket Connection Fails**:
    -   Ensure the backend container is running: `docker ps`.
    -   Check the backend logs for errors: `docker-compose logs backend`.
    -   Verify the backend is accessible at `http://localhost:5000/api/health`.

-   **Frontend Fails to Start**:
    -   Ensure you are in the project root directory when running `docker-compose`.
    -   Check frontend logs: `docker-compose logs frontend`.

-   **No Vulnerabilities Detected**:
    -   Verify the target is accessible from within the Docker container.
    -   Try scanning a known vulnerable application (like OWASP Juice Shop) to confirm the scanner is working.
    -   Check if the target is protected by a WAF that might be blocking scan traffic.

## üîí Legal & Ethical Use

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This tool is intended for professional and ethical use only. You must only scan targets that you own or have explicit, written permission to test. Unauthorized scanning of systems is illegal and can lead to severe legal consequences. The developers of CyberSage are not responsible for any misuse of this tool.
